## Description

I'm finally making a repo out of this. Took me a while, but now that I'm finally used to the git + ruby on rails enviroment I need to speed up some things.

Commands include:

- Git
- Ruby
- Rails
- Rake
- etc.

Since I'm using [Redcar](http://redcareditor.com/) (which is awesome!) I can use textmate bundles, but that's something I still need to investigate. They will be included here.
